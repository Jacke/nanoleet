Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array,https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/,Easy,Array,[two-pointer],"To remove duplicates from a sorted integer array in-place and keep the relative order of the elements, we use two pointers, one to keep track of the unique elements and the other to traverse the array, while swapping the non-unique elements to the end of the array, which are then trimmed to return the count of unique elements."
Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II,https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/,Easy,Array,"[Brute-Force,Peak-Valley,One-Pass]","We find the maximum profit by iterating over the given prices array, keeping track of the minimum price seen so far and updating the maximum profit possible by subtracting the minimum price from the current price, and return the maximum profit obtained."
Rotate Array,https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/,Easy,Array,"[Brute-Force, Extra Array, Cyclic Replacements, Reverse]","We rotate the given integer array to the right by k steps by reversing the entire array, then reversing the first k elements and finally reversing the remaining elements."
